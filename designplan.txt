I'll make a CV. A top part and bottom part (that then further divides). 2x1

A top bar with name and my current position (student right now). Have this in a 2x1 design.

A bottom part, split into three columns - 
left part has contact, skills, education. 3x1
A middle part, with projects and work experience 2x1
A right part, with picture and an about me section. With an empty lower part. 3x1.
In total, the bottom part is a 1x3.
